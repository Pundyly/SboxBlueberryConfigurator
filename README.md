# 🫐 S&box Blueberry Configurator 🫐

A small, user-friendly GUI application (written in Go + [Fyne](https://fyne.io)) that helps you generate a ready-to-use `graphics_config.vcfg` for S&box. Use it to quickly toggle graphics options and save a configuration file directly into your S&box installation.

## Features

- Lightweight GUI for editing common S&box graphics options (booleans, integers, floats, and text).
- Boolean options shown as checkboxes; numeric and text options use input fields.
- Top-level Path field to specify your S&box root folder manually or with a folder picker.
- "Select Folder" button to open a folder selection dialog.
- "Save" button:
  - Ensures the target folder `<path>/core/cfg` exists (creates it if missing).
  - Writes `graphics_config.vcfg` with a header comment and key/value lines.
  - Booleans are written as `1` (true) or `0` (false).

## Why use this

- Avoid manual editing and formatting mistakes in `graphics_config.vcfg`.
- Quickly experiment with settings and save a file the game can execute on startup.

## File location and Steam launch option

Save the generated file to:

<path_to_sbox>/core/cfg/graphics_config.vcfg

To make S&box execute the config automatically on launch, add this to Steam Launch Options:

-exec graphics_config.vcfg

This ensures the game applies your custom graphics settings every time it starts.

## Build & Run

Prerequisites:
- Go (1.19+ recommended)
- Fyne (v2+) — see https://fyne.io for installation instructions

Build:
- git clone <repo>
- cd <repo>
- go build -o blueberry

Run:
- ./blueberry
or
- go run ./...

The application opens a simple GUI where you can set options, choose the S&box installation folder, and save the config.

## Config file format

The generated `graphics_config.vcfg` contains:
- A header comment describing the file (human-readable).
- One option per line in the format:
  key value
- Boolean values are written as `1` (enabled) or `0` (disabled).

Example:
```
# graphics_config.vcfg — generated by Blueberry
r_fullscreen 1
r_viewdistance 2000
r_post_processing 0
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the file is not applied on launch:
  - Ensure the file is saved to `<sbox_root>/core/cfg/graphics_config.vcfg`.
  - Confirm you added `-exec graphics_config.vcfg` to Steam's Launch Options for S&box.
- If the app cannot write the file, check folder write permissions and verify the selected path is correct.
