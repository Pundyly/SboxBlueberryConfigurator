# 🫐 S&box Blueberry Configurator 🫐

A small, user-friendly GUI application (written in Go + [Fyne](https://fyne.io)) that helps you generate a ready-to-use `graphics_config.vcfg` for S&box. Use it to quickly toggle graphics options and save a configuration file directly into your S&box installation.

## Why use this

- Avoid manual editing and formatting mistakes in `graphics_config.vcfg`.
- Quickly experiment with settings and save a file the game can execute on startup.

## File location and Steam launch option

Save the generated file to:

<path_to_sbox>/core/cfg/graphics_config.vcfg

To make S&box execute the config automatically on launch, add this to Steam Launch Options:

-exec graphics_config.vcfg

This ensures the game applies your custom graphics settings every time it starts.

## Run — executable (.exe)

This application is commonly distributed as a standalone Windows executable (`.exe`). If you have a prebuilt executable:

- Windows:
  - Double-click the `sboxblueberrycongigurator.exe` to open the GUI.
  - Or open a command prompt, navigate to the folder containing `sboxblueberrycongigurator.exe` and run:
    blueberry.exe

- If you prefer running from the command line it will launch the same GUI; there are no required command-line arguments by default.

If you ship the `.exe` in a release, include a small note for users to unblock the file if Windows prevents execution (right-click → Properties → Unblock).

## Build & Run (from source)

## Run

Run:
- On Windows: double-click `sboxblueberrycongigurator.exe` or run it from PowerShell/cmd.
- On macOS/Linux: ./blueberry (or run with go run ./... during development)

## Config file format

Example:
```
# graphics_config.vcfg — generated by Blueberry
r_fullscreen 1
r_viewdistance 2000
r_post_processing 0
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the file is not applied on launch:
  - Ensure the file is saved to `<sbox_root>/core/cfg/graphics_config.vcfg`.
  - Confirm you added `-exec graphics_config.vcfg` to Steam's Launch Options for S&box.
- If the app cannot write the file, check folder write permissions and verify the selected path is correct.
- On Windows, if the `.exe` won't run, check Antivirus/smart screen settings and try unblocking the file in Properties.
